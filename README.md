## PyTTS - The Python Text to Speech implementation
This is a simple Windows application using Python and gTTS to save speech converted from Text as mp3 files.
Currently the "speak" button does not work as Windows does not have PortAudio installed by default and doing so is a tedious and taxing process.
The UI is made with the `PyQt` library for python which is available through `pip`.
